More formally, if p is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), pi is the i'th character in p, and k is a secret key (i.e., a non-negative integer), then each letter,
ci, in the ciphertext, c, is computed as:
ci = (pi + k) % 26
wherein % 26 means "remainder when dividing by 26."

P = H E L L O
k = 1 1 1 1 1
c = I F M N P

ci = (p0 + 1)%26
ci = (7 + 1)%26

when (x + y) is less than 26, the remainder is x+y
when " is larger than 26, the remainder is useful for wrapping around the alphabet

Write a program
user enters ./caesar key
program gets user plaintext string
program outputs cyphertex string
    preserves caps, punc, non alpha characters
